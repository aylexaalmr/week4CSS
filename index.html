            <h2>My Favorite Artist - TWICE</h2>
            <p>Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; commonly stylized in all caps) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October 20, 2015, with the extended play (EP) The Story Begins, and has received the honorific title of "The Nation's Girl Group" in their home country.
            art of a partnership with JYP Entertainment, the group achieved five top-ten albums on the US Billboard 200 and topped the chart in 2024 with their thirteenth extended play With You-th. Their first official English-language single, "The Feels" (2021), became their first song to enter the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, peaking at the 83rd and 80th positions of the charts, respectively. Their point choreography—including for "Cheer Up" (2016), "TT" (2016), "Signal" (2017), and "What Is Love?" (2018)—became dance crazes and viral memes.
